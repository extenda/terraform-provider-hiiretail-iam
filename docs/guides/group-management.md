# Managing HiiRetail IAM Groups

This guide provides comprehensive information about managing IAM groups using the HiiRetail IAM provider.

## Overview

IAM groups in HiiRetail are used to organize users and manage permissions efficiently. Instead of attaching permissions to individual users, you can create groups with specific permissions and then add users to those groups.

## Best Practices

1. **Use Descriptive Names**
   - Choose group names that clearly indicate the group's purpose
   - Follow a consistent naming convention

2. **Proper Documentation**
   - Use detailed descriptions that explain the group's purpose
   - Document any specific permissions or roles associated with the group

3. **Group Organization**
   - Create groups based on job functions or access requirements
   - Avoid creating groups for individual users
   - Keep group structures flat when possible

## Common Workflows

### Creating a New Group

```hcl
resource "hiiretail-iam_group" "developers" {
  name        = "developers"
  description = "Development team with access to development resources"
}
```

### Importing Existing Groups

To import an existing group into Terraform management:

1. Add the resource to your configuration:
```hcl
resource "hiiretail-iam_group" "existing" {
  name        = "existing-group"
  description = "Existing group imported into Terraform"
}
```

2. Import the group using its ID:
```shell
terraform import hiiretail-iam_group.existing group-123456
```

### Updating Groups

Groups can be updated by modifying the Terraform configuration:

```hcl
resource "hiiretail-iam_group" "developers" {
  name        = "senior-developers"  # Changed name
  description = "Senior development team with elevated access"  # Updated description
}
```

### Deleting Groups

Groups are automatically deleted when removed from the Terraform configuration. Ensure all users are removed from the group before deletion.

## Error Handling

Common errors and their solutions:

1. **Group Already Exists**
   - Ensure group names are unique within your organization
   - Import existing groups instead of creating new ones

2. **Import Failures**
   - Verify the group ID is correct
   - Ensure you have necessary permissions

## Security Considerations

1. **Access Control**
   - Follow the principle of least privilege
   - Regularly review group memberships and permissions

2. **Naming Security**
   - Avoid including sensitive information in group names or descriptions
   - Use generic role-based names instead of individual names
