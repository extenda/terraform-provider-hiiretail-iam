# Feature Specification: IAM Group Resource

**Feature Branch**: `001-add-iam-group`  
**Created**: 2025-09-25  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Add IAM group resource with name, description, and id"

## Overview
Implement a new Terraform resource for managing HiiRetail IAM groups. This will allow users to create, read, update, and delete IAM groups through Terraform, with support for basic group attributes including name, description, and ID management.

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a Terraform user managing HiiRetail IAM infrastructure, I want to manage IAM groups through Terraform so that I can maintain consistent group configurations as code.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** no IAM group exists  
   **When** I apply a Terraform configuration with a new IAM group  
   **Then** the group is created with specified name and description

2. **Given** an existing IAM group  
   **When** I update its description in the Terraform configuration  
   **Then** the group's description is updated while preserving its ID and name

3. **Given** an existing IAM group  
   **When** I remove it from the Terraform configuration  
   **Then** the group is deleted from the IAM system

4. **Given** an existing IAM group in the system  
   **When** I import it using its ID  
   **Then** Terraform successfully manages the group's state

### Edge Cases
- What happens when creating a group with a name that already exists?
  - Must return clear error about name uniqueness constraint
- What happens when trying to delete a group that has members?
  - Must handle API errors gracefully and provide clear message about removing members first
- What happens when group name contains special characters?
  - Must validate name according to API constraints

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST support creating new IAM groups with name and optional description
- **FR-002**: System MUST read existing group attributes and update Terraform state
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow updating group description
- **FR-004**: System MUST support deleting IAM groups
- **FR-005**: System MUST support importing existing groups via their ID
- **FR-006**: System MUST validate group names according to API rules
- **FR-007**: System MUST preserve group ID between updates
- **FR-008**: System MUST detect and handle name conflicts during creation

### Resource Schema
```hcl
resource "hiiretail_iam_group" "example" {
  name        = string           # Required: Group name
  description = optional(string) # Optional: Group description
  id          = string          # Optional: An optional id of a group. Will be auto-generated if not passed
}
```

### Key Entities
- **IAM Group**: Represents a collection of IAM users
  - name: Unique identifier for the group
  - description: Optional human-readable description
  - id: An optional id of a group. Will be auto-generated if not passed

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: Group operations must complete within 10 seconds
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for:
  - Name conflicts
  - Invalid characters in name/description
  - API errors with troubleshooting guidance
- **State Management**: 
  - Safe handling of partial failures
  - Proper state refresh after operations
  - Import support for existing groups
- **Documentation**:
  - Resource documentation with all attributes
  - Example configurations for common scenarios
  - Import instructions with example commands
